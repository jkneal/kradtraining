<%-- This tag is from textAttribute.tag -r 1.3's isLabel attribute.
When I refactored testAttribute.tag and textareaAttribute.tag into htmlControlAttribute.tag
for KULNRVSYS-872, this part of the tag didn't fit because it wasn't using the DataDictionary's
attribute entry, so I refactored this part into this separate tag.
I'm not sure what it's doing or what the following comment means. --%>

<%-- would be better to use the bean:write but had problems to get the KualiForm into property with JSTL
${KualiForm.document.budget.fringeRates[ctr].appointmentType.fringeRateAmount} --%>
<html:hidden property="${property}"/><bean:write name="KualiForm" property="${property}"/>
